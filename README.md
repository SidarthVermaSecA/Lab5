# Lab5

Hello Readers,

This is a lab about a responsiveness and aesthetic music-themed website. 

Starting from the beginning, 

Various CSS attributes have been used in the navbar to equip with a floating effect and background shadows when hovered over. There are 3 available links in total on the navbar, which lead to the same page but different parts, the song will take you the songs section of the page, likewise for the artist and home button.

below the navbar, 
Section semantic tag has been used to create two banners in one line coming from opposite sides of the screen and have some text on them. 

In the main section of the page;
Top 6 songs have been mentioned with their album cover and songs name and the artists name, which altogether creates a card-type arrangement for the 6 songs. Required CSS styling was applied to the main section to make it look presentable and visually appealing. 

Within the main section,
After the songs, top artists have been mentioned in the similar format with their profile pictures and names, again in a card-type arrangement.

In the end,
A footer was added with relevant information about the page

** Required responsive media queries were added throught the content of the page to make it more accessible to various forms of devices.
